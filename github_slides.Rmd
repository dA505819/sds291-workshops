# Prereqs

We are starting with the assumption that you are using the [**RStudio Desktop**](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) and are familiar with R and RStudio.

* If you haven't downloaded RStudio, that has to happen first.

---
# Why Git & GitHub?

Version control: keep track of changes to files

--

- Very important for **collaboration**.

- Also helps build a public portfolio!

- Can interface easily with RStudio.

--

GitHub is to RStudio as Google Drive is to Word.

* In RStudio I can make changes to a `.Rmd`, but noone else can see those changes.

* When I incorporate GitHub, other people can collaborate on my R code!

The difference: if I add a few words to a Google doc it doesn't break anything, but in an `.Rmd` it might! This means GitHub has a system of checks so that we don't break each other's code.

# Create a GitHub Account

### Tips

* **Put some thought into your username!** This will be part of your personal brand - it should be short and easy to remember, and something you are comfortable sharing with bosses and the public. 

 + Consider including your name so people will associate it with you.

 + Keep letters lowercase (GitHub is not case sensitive, this is to help out other users)
 
 + Stay away from words associated with programming.
 
--

* Use a **personal** email address, not one you won't have access to in a few years like a student email address.

* Remember your password for later!

# Work time: GitHub Account

By the end of this break-out session you need to have a GitHub account ready to go.

---
# Install Git

You may already have Git installed. In the Terminal (a tab option next to the console), type

`which git`

and 

` git --version`

If a version comes up for you, you already have Git installed!

--

If you get something like `git: command not found` continue with the following steps.

---
# Install Git

## Windows Installation

Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

* When asked about "Adjusting your PATH environment", select "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"

--
## macOS Installation

Install the Xcode command line tools (not all of Xcode)

Go to the terminal and enter:

`git --version`

or

`git config`

Accept the offer and click "Install"


---
# "Sign in" to Git

In the Terminal, type the following lines one at a time, substituting in your own username and email address

`git config --global user.name "USERNAME"`

`git config --global user.email "EMAIL"`

`git config -- global --list`

If you would rather do this using a package and function, try

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "USERNAME", user.email = "EMAIL")
```



---
# Work time: Git installation

By the end of this break-out session you should have Git installed on your computer and have introduced yourself to Git.
---
# Getting started with GitHub

* Have **one person** on your team make a repository on GitHub

 + a repository is basically the kind of folder we use to easily interact with GitHub. 
 
* Click either "New repository" or from the "Repositories" page, click "New"

 + Name your repository something memorable and related to your project
 
 + My test repo is "sds291-team73"
 
 + Select "Public"
 
 + **Make sure to initialize the repository with a README**

# .Rproj

A "project" can be thought of like a "project folder" or a workspace. 

* They make for easier organization

* Facilitate collaboration through GitHub

---
# Clone or Download

Cloning or downloading a repository is how we connect an `.Rproj` to the GitHub repository.

We start this process from within GitHub, and then move to RStudio.

* You can do it the other way around, but it makes managing files more complicated! I **highly** recommend that when you are starting a new project, start by making a repository on GitHub and then creating the R project.

---
# Work time: .Rproj

Make sure everyone in your group is in an R project associated with the repository.

---
# Test Connection

Your `.Rproj` and GitHub repository should now be connected! 

Test this connection by opening the README.md and adding your name!

# GitHub Actions: Commit

**COMMIT**: saving changes you have made.

* A commit is associated with a specific tag (such as "c2ec6cf") and a **commit message** (such as "Added header and name to readme")

* When to commit?

  + Early and often
  
  + When you find yourself transitioning to a new task (i.e. starting a new visualization, reading in a new file, starting a new model)
  
Collaborators can't see your changes yet.
  
---
# GitHub Actions: Pull

**PULL**: merging changes from collaborators into your own copy. 

* When to pull?

 + When you first sit down to start coding
 
 + Before you push

---
# GitHub Actions: Push

**PUSH**: sending your commits to GitHub.

* When to push?

 + After you commit
 
 + Before you stop coding
 
---
# GitHub Workflow

To minimize merge conflicts:

1. commit

2. pull

3. push
